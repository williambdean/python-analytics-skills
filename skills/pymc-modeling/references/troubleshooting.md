## Shape and Dimension Errors

### The Parameter-Observation Dimension Mismatch

**Problem**: `ValueError` about shape mismatch during model initialization.

**Root cause**: Confusing the dimensions of parameter priors with the dimensions of the likelihood. In hierarchical models, parameters are defined at the group level (K groups) while the likelihood must evaluate at every observation (N data points).

**Example of the error**:
```python
# BAD: Likelihood sized to number of groups, not observations
with pm.Model() as bad_model:
    alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", 0, 1, shape=4)  # 4 groups
    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=alpha, sigma=1, observed=y_obs)  # y_obs has 100 points!
    # Error: alpha has shape (4,), y_obs has shape (100,)
```

**Solution**: Use index vectors to expand group parameters to observation size.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create index mapping observations to groups
group_idx, group_labels = pd.factorize(df["group"], sort=True)

coords = {
    "group": group_labels,
    "obs": np.arange(len(df)),
}

with pm.Model(coords=coords) as correct_model:
    # Group-level parameter: shape (K,)
    alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", 0, 1, dims="group")
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", 1)

    # Index into group parameters: alpha[group_idx] has shape (N,)
    mu = alpha[group_idx]

    # Likelihood: shape (N,)
    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs, dims="obs")
```

**Key insight**: The log-likelihood is a sum over individual data points. Every observation must have a corresponding mean value, so `alpha[group_idx]` expands the K group effects to N observations.

### Likelihood Size Independence from Parameters

**Common misconception**: New users often try to "shrink" the likelihood to match the number of groups.

**Reality**: The likelihood size is always determined by the number of observations, regardless of how many parameters the model has. A linear regression with 3 parameters and 100 observations has a likelihood of size 100.

```python
# The model evaluates (y_i - mu_group[i]) for every i in 1...N
# NOT once per group
```

---

## Initialization Failures

### "Initial evaluation of model at starting point failed"

**Problem**: Log-probability is `-inf` or `NaN` at the initial parameter values.

**Cause 1: Data outside distribution support**

```python
# BAD: Observations outside truncation bounds
with pm.Model() as bad_model:
    mu = pm.Normal("mu", 0, 1)
    # TruncatedNormal bounded below at 0
    y = pm.TruncatedNormal("y", mu=mu, sigma=1, lower=0, observed=y_obs)
    # If y_obs contains negative values, log-likelihood = -inf
```

**Solution**: Verify observed data matches the likelihood's support.

```python
# Check data before modeling
print(f"y range: [{y_obs.min()}, {y_obs.max()}]")

# For bounded distributions, ensure data is within bounds
assert y_obs.min() >= 0, "Data contains negative values!"
```

**Cause 2: Initialization jitter pushes parameters outside support**

PyMC's default `jitter+adapt_diag` initialization adds random noise to starting values. For constrained parameters (e.g., positive-only), this can create invalid starting points.

```python
# Solution 1: Reduce or eliminate jitter
idata = pm.sample(init="adapt_diag")  # no jitter

# Solution 2: Specify valid initial values
with model:
    idata = pm.sample(initvals={"sigma": 1.0})

# Solution 3: Use ADVI for more robust initialization
with model:
    idata = pm.sample(init="advi+adapt_diag")
```

**Cause 3: Constant response variable**

When the response variable has zero variance (all values identical), automatic prior selection in tools like Bambi may set scale parameters to zero.

```python
# Check for constant response
if y_obs.std() == 0:
    print("WARNING: Response variable is constant!")
```

### Debugging Initialization

```python
# Check which variables have invalid log-probabilities
model.point_logps()

# Run model diagnostics
model.debug()
```

---

## Mass Matrix and Numerical Issues

### "Mass matrix contains zeros on the diagonal"

**Problem**: HMC's mass matrix has zero diagonal elements, preventing exploration of those dimensions.

**Root cause**: The derivative of the log-probability with respect to some parameter is numerically zero, usually due to:

1. **Unscaled predictors**
2. **Underconstrained parameters** (flat likelihood regions)

### Unscaled Predictors

When predictors are on vastly different scales, gradients for large-scale variables become numerically indistinguishable from zero.

```python
# BAD: Features on different scales
X = np.column_stack([
    feature_0_to_1,      # range [0, 1]
    feature_0_to_million  # range [0, 1,000,000]
])
# Gradient w.r.t. large-scale feature may underflow
```

**Solution**: Standardize all predictors.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Now all features have mean=0, std=1
# Priors can use unit-scale: beta ~ Normal(0, 1)
```

### Underconstrained Parameters (Flat Energy Landscape)

When data provides no information about a parameter (e.g., a group with no observations), the likelihood is flat and gradients are zero.

```python
# Check for empty groups
for group in group_labels:
    n_obs = (df["group"] == group).sum()
    if n_obs == 0:
        print(f"WARNING: Group '{group}' has no observations!")
```

**Solution**: Use weakly informative priors to provide "soft" curvature.

```python
# BAD: Flat or very diffuse priors
sigma = pm.Uniform("sigma", 0, 100)

# GOOD: Weakly informative prior provides curvature
sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", sigma=1)
```

---

## Divergences and Geometry Problems

### Understanding Divergences

Divergences occur when the Hamiltonian integrator fails to conserve energy during a leapfrog step. This signals that the sampler encountered a region where the posterior geometry is too curved to navigate accurately.

### The Funnel Geometry

In hierarchical models, when group-level variance is small, individual effects are constrained to a narrow region. As variance increases, the region expands. This creates a "funnel" shape that is difficult for NUTS to navigate.

```python
# Centered parameterization creates funnel
# When sigma_group is small, alpha values are tightly constrained
alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", mu=mu_group, sigma=sigma_group, dims="group")
```

### Non-Centered Reparameterization

The standard fix transforms the funnel into an isotropic Gaussian.

```python
# BEFORE: Centered (funnel geometry)
alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", mu_group, sigma_group, dims="group")

# AFTER: Non-centered (spherical geometry)
z = pm.Normal("z", 0, 1, dims="group")  # standard normal
alpha = pm.Deterministic("alpha", mu_group + sigma_group * z, dims="group")
```

| Parameterization | Best For | Geometry |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Centered | Dense data per group | Direct hierarchy representation |
| Non-centered | Sparse/imbalanced data | Decouples effects from variance |

**When to use which**:
- Non-centered: Fewer than ~20 observations per group on average
- Centered: Many observations per group (likelihood "pins" parameters)

### Increasing Target Acceptance

For scattered divergences (not clustered in funnels), try increasing `target_accept`:

```python
# Default is 0.8; increase for difficult posteriors
idata = pm.sample(target_accept=0.95)

# For very difficult models
idata = pm.sample(target_accept=0.99)
```

**Trade-off**: Higher target acceptance means smaller step sizes and slower sampling.

---

## Non-Differentiable Operations

### The Clipping Problem

Using `pm.math.clip()` or similar hard constraints creates regions where gradients are exactly zero.

```python
# BAD: Hard clipping creates flat gradient regions
mu = pm.math.clip(x, 0, np.inf)
# Gradients are zero in clipped regions, causing divergences
```

**Solution 1: Use soft alternatives**

```python
# Softplus maps R -> R+ with smooth gradients
from pytensor.tensor.nnet import softplus

mu = softplus(x)  # log(1 + exp(x))
```

**Solution 2: Use distributions with natural constraints**

```python
# Instead of clipping to positive, use naturally positive distributions
sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", 1)  # automatically positive
rate = pm.LogNormal("rate", 0, 1)  # automatically positive
```

### Python Conditionals in Models

Python `if/else` statements are evaluated at model construction time, not sampling time.

```python
# BAD: Python conditional doesn't work during sampling
if x > 0:  # evaluated once when model is built!
    result = a
else:
    result = b
```

**Solution**: Use PyTensor symbolic conditionals.

```python
import pytensor.tensor as pt

# GOOD: Symbolic conditional evaluated during sampling
result = pt.switch(x > 0, a, b)

# For more complex conditionals
from pytensor.ifelse import ifelse
result = ifelse(condition, true_value, false_value)
```

For iterative logic (loops that depend on random variables), use `pytensor.scan`.

## Discrete Variable Challenges

### NUTS Cannot Handle Discrete Latent Variables

NUTS is a gradient-based method and cannot differentiate through discrete nodes (Bernoulli, Poisson, Categorical with latent values).

**Symptom**: PyMC automatically reverts to compound sampling (NUTS for continuous, Metropolis for discrete), resulting in poor mixing.

### Solution 1: Marginalization

Analytically integrate out the discrete variable, replacing it with a continuous mixture.

```python
# BEFORE: Discrete latent variable (poor mixing)
with pm.Model() as discrete_model:
    z = pm.Bernoulli("z", p=0.5, shape=N)  # discrete latent
    mu = pm.math.switch(z, mu1, mu0)
    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=1, observed=y_obs)

# AFTER: Marginalized mixture (NUTS-friendly)
with pm.Model() as marginalized_model:
    p = pm.Beta("p", 2, 2)
    mu0 = pm.Normal("mu0", 0, 1)
    mu1 = pm.Normal("mu1", 0, 1)
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", 1)

    y = pm.NormalMixture("y", w=[1-p, p], mu=[mu0, mu1], sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs)
```

### Solution 2: Continuous Relaxation

Approximate discrete switches with continuous sigmoid functions.

```python
# Soft approximation of a discrete switch
temperature = 0.1  # lower = sharper
soft_z = pm.math.sigmoid((x - threshold) / temperature)
mu = soft_z * mu1 + (1 - soft_z) * mu0
```

### Prior Sampling with Discrete Variables

**Common mistake**: Using `pm.sample()` to sample priors from a model with discrete variables.

```python
# BAD: pm.sample() uses MCMC, struggles with discrete priors
with discrete_model:
    prior = pm.sample(draws=1000)  # slow, poor convergence

# GOOD: Use ancestral sampling for priors
with discrete_model:
    prior = pm.sample_prior_predictive(draws=1000)  # instant, exact
```

---

## Data Container and Prediction Issues

### Mutable Data for Out-of-Sample Prediction

Static NumPy arrays are baked into the model graph and cannot be changed for prediction.

```python
# BAD: Static data prevents out-of-sample prediction
with pm.Model() as static_model:
    X_train = np.array(...)  # fixed at model construction
    mu = pm.math.dot(X_train, beta)
    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=1, observed=y_train)
```

**Solution**: Use `pm.Data` containers.

```python
with pm.Model() as mutable_model:
    X = pm.Data("X", X_train)
    y_obs = pm.Data("y_obs", y_train)

    beta = pm.Normal("beta", 0, 1, dims="features")
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", 1)

    mu = pm.math.dot(X, beta)
    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs, shape=X.shape[0])

    idata = pm.sample()

# Predict on new data
with mutable_model:
    pm.set_data({"X": X_test, "y_obs": np.zeros(len(X_test))})
    ppc = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(idata)
```

### Shape Tracking for Variable-Size Predictions

**Critical**: The likelihood shape must track the data container shape.

```python
# BAD: Fixed shape doesn't update with new data
y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs)  # shape inferred from y_obs at construction

# GOOD: Shape linked to data container
y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs, shape=X.shape[0])
```

---

## Coordinate and Dimension Management

### Multi-Level Hierarchy Index Management

For nested hierarchies (e.g., observations within cities within states), avoid MultiIndex complications.

```python
# Create independent factorized indices for each level
city_idx, city_labels = pd.factorize(df["city"], sort=True)
state_idx, state_labels = pd.factorize(df["state"], sort=True)

coords = {
    "city": city_labels,
    "state": state_labels,
    "obs": np.arange(len(df)),
}

with pm.Model(coords=coords) as hierarchical:
    # State-level effects
    alpha_state = pm.Normal("alpha_state", 0, 1, dims="state")

    # City-level effects
    alpha_city = pm.Normal("alpha_city", 0, sigma_city, dims="city")

    # Combine at observation level
    mu = alpha_state[state_idx] + alpha_city[city_idx]

    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs, dims="obs")
```

### Consistent Factorization Across Data Splits

**Critical error**: Factorizing training and test sets separately creates inconsistent mappings.

```python
# BAD: Separate factorization
train_idx, train_labels = pd.factorize(train_df["group"])
test_idx, test_labels = pd.factorize(test_df["group"])
# "group 0" in train may be different from "group 0" in test!

# GOOD: Use categorical types for consistent mapping
df["group"] = pd.Categorical(df["group"])
train_df = df[train_mask]
test_df = df[~train_mask]

# Category codes are now consistent
train_idx = train_df["group"].cat.codes
test_idx = test_df["group"].cat.codes
```

---

## Compositional Data Constraints

### Multinomial Count Constraints

**Problem**: Observed counts don't sum to the specified `n` parameter.

```python
# Each row of observed counts must sum to n
observed_counts = np.array([[5, 3, 2], [4, 4, 2]])  # each row sums to 10
n_trials = observed_counts.sum(axis=1)  # [10, 10]

with pm.Model() as multinomial_model:
    p = pm.Dirichlet("p", a=np.ones(3))
    y = pm.Multinomial("y", n=n_trials, p=p, observed=observed_counts)
```

### Dirichlet Simplex Constraints

The probability vector `p` in Dirichlet-Multinomial models must sum to 1. Ensure any indexing operations preserve this constraint.

---

## Prior-Related Pathologies

### Log-Probability Overflows in Gamma/Beta Models

When modeling with Gamma or Beta likelihoods, parameters calculated through exponential transformations can overflow.

```python
# BAD: Exponential growth can overflow
mu_inv = pm.math.exp(lambda_param * pm.math.log(x))
# If lambda is large, mu_inv can exceed 10^20, causing overflow

# Solution 1: Use Softplus instead of Exp
mu_inv = pm.math.softplus(linear_predictor)

# Solution 2: Log-transform the data
log_y = np.log(y_obs)
y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu_log, sigma=sigma, observed=log_y)
```

### Over-Tight Priors and Link Function Failure

Priors that are too narrow can "lock" the model, especially with link functions on new data.

```python
# If prior on slope is very tight: beta ~ Normal(0, 0.1)
# And new X values are much larger than training X
# Then sigmoid(X_new @ beta) can be exactly 0 or 1
# This causes log(0) = -inf in the likelihood
```

**Solution**: Use prior predictive checks across the expected range of predictors.

```python
with model:
    prior = pm.sample_prior_predictive(draws=500)

# Check that prior predictions are valid across expected X range
# Not just the training data range
```

### The Horseshoe Prior Challenge

Horseshoe priors have a massive spike at zero and heavy tails, creating a "double-funnel" geometry.

```python
# Horseshoe often requires very high target_accept
idata = pm.sample(target_accept=0.99)

# Consider Regularized Horseshoe for better geometry (manual implementation)
# See priors.md for full regularized horseshoe code

# Or use simpler Laplace prior if sufficient
beta = pm.Laplace("beta", mu=0, b=1, dims="features")
```

### Redundant Intercepts in Hierarchical Models

**Problem**: Defining an intercept for every predictor creates non-identifiability.

```python
# BAD: Intercept per predictor (non-identifiable)
with pm.Model() as over_param:
    intercept_age = pm.Normal("int_age", 0, 1)
    intercept_income = pm.Normal("int_income", 0, 1)
    # These compete with each other and with group intercepts

# GOOD: Single intercept per group + slopes for predictors
with pm.Model() as correct:
    group_intercept = pm.Normal("group_intercept", mu_global, sigma_group, dims="group")
    slope_age = pm.Normal("slope_age", 0, 1)
    slope_income = pm.Normal("slope_income", 0, 1)

    mu = group_intercept[group_idx] + slope_age * age + slope_income * income
```
